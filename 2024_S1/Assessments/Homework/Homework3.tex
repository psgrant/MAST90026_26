\part*{ Homework 3 \\ Due: 11:00AM Wednesday, 20th March.}   

This homework is worth 5\% of the total assessment in this subject.  
You should submit copies of {\sc Matlab}  programs (include all files necessary for the programs to run) 
and sufficient relevant output online through LMS (You may find the Matlab command publish useful!). Any hand written working should be scanned and converted to a PDF. 
\medskip

All files should be compressed into a single zip file \emph{with your student ID number in the file name}.



\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Consider the following BVP:
$$
-u^{\prime \prime}(x)+u(x)=f(x), \quad 0<x<1, \quad u(0)=u(1)=0 .
$$
Derive the linear system of the equations for the finite element approximation
$$
u_{h}=\sum_{j=1}^{3} \alpha_{j} \phi_{j}(x)
$$
with the following information:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	 $f(x)=1$;
\item  the nodal points and the elements are indexed as
$$
\begin{aligned}
&x_{0}=0, \quad x_{1}=\frac{1}{4}, \quad x_{2}=\frac{1}{2}, \quad x_{3}=\frac{3}{4}, \quad x_{4}=1 \\
&E_{1}=\left[x_{0}, x_{1}\right], \quad E_{2}=\left[x_{1}, x_{2}\right], \quad E_{3}=\left[x_{2}, x_{3}\right], \quad E_{4}=\left[x_{3}, x_{4}\right]
\end{aligned}
$$
\item  the basis functions are the hat functions
$$
\phi_{i}\left(x_{j}\right)= \begin{cases}1, & \text { if } i=j \\ 0, & \text { otherwise }\end{cases}
$$
\item  assemble the stiffness/mass matrix and the load vector element by element. 
\end{itemize}
What do you find the linear system to be? 
 
\item   Derive the Galerkin equations (for a given basis $\{\phi_j\}$) for the case of mixed BCs
\[ u(a)-u'(a) = \alpha, u(b) = \beta. \]

\item Write code to use finite elements with linear basis functions on uniform mesh to solve the constant coefficient Dirichlet BVP:
\[ -u'' + q u = r;\ \ u(a) = \alpha, u(b) = \beta,   \] 
 where $q, r,a,b, \alpha, \beta$ are constants.  
 
 Test your code on problem  from Homework 2:
\[ -u'' + u = 0;\ \ u(0) = 1, u(1) = \exp(1),   \] 
 and plot the maximum grid error $\max |e_j|$ versus $N$ 
as a log-log plot. What is the rate of convergence?
 
Submit the {\sc Matlab} code and the resulting error plot.

\end{enumerate}
